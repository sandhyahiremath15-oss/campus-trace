## Style Guidelines:

- Light color scheme, reflecting clarity and an approachable community spirit.
- Primary accent color: A reliable medium blue (#2466B3) conveying trust and help, used for interactive elements and key headings.
- Background color: A very light, subtle blue-grey (#EBF1F6) to provide a clean and calm canvas.
- Accent color: A vibrant teal-green (#4DDBC2) for call-to-action buttons and notifications, signifying resolution and connection.
- Headline and body font: 'Inter', a clean and modern sans-serif for excellent readability across all text sizes, maintaining a professional and contemporary feel.
- Use a set of clear, outline-style icons that visually represent item categories, statuses (lost/found), and user actions (e.g., 'post', 'search').
- A responsive, grid-based layout for item listings, ensuring an organized and digestible display on various screen sizes. Focus on ample whitespace to enhance readability and reduce clutter.
- Subtle transitions and micro-animations for feedback on user interactions, such as form submissions, item filtering, and AI matching suggestions, to improve user experience without being distracting.
